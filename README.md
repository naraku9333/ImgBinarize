# ImgBinarize
Binarize an 8 bit grayscale image.

JavaFX application allows to open an image.
It is then binarized, converted into a 2 color (black and white) image.
Binarized image can be saved to disk.

Depends on [Cluster](https://github.com/naraku9333/Cluster)
build Cluster into a jar archive and add to classpath when building ImgBinarize.

This is my first foray into the JavaFX world. This project was written for academic purposes.
